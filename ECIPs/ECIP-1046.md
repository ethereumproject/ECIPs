# ECIP 1046 - Merkle Inclusion Proofs

## Abstract 

Verification of Merkle Inclusion Proofs is obviously possible in EVM bytecode.
However, the gas cost for such an operation is very high.

The addition of a native compiled function, in a precompiled contract, to the
EVM solves the cost problem.

<!-- TODO: maybe refer to performance too? -->
