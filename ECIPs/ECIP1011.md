### Abstract
This ECIP describes the process of modifiying the ETC hash process used for signing and validating transactions for inclusion into the ETC blockchain, where the proposed approach is akin to the BTC process.

### Motivation
Other methods proposed for the replay fix require either modification of key symbolic values (i.e. the account nonce) or increasing the transaction sizes by adding an extra field to the transactions (e.g. a reference block hash). Such modifications impact backward compatibility of transaction structures. With the approach prosed here there is no change in the structure of the transaction, however there would be a minimal modification for the transaction signing and validation process. This difference would take the form of adding an extra arbitray value to the transaction prior to performing the hash. This would result in a unique message and thus signature that would differ from that of the ETH chain. Such processes will be cryptographically secure, and ensure that all transactions broadcast from the ETH network cannot be accepted in the ETC network and vice-versa.

### Specification
In the Bitcoin protocol the scriptPubKey script is copied from the source transaction into the spending transaction (i.e. the transaction that is being signed) before calculating the signature. Then the signature script, scriptSig, is embedded in the transaction. Using the previous transaction's scriptPubKey during signing is for historical reasons rather than any logical reason.

In the ethereum protocol a transaction (formally, ```T```) is a single cryptographically-signed instruction constructed by an actor externally to the scope of Ethereum. Both, message call and contract creation transatcions, specify a number of common felds: ```T=(T_n, T_p, T_g, T_t, T_v, T_(i or d),T_w, T_r, T_s)```,  where ```T_w, T_r, T_s``` are the signature components for the elliptic curve digital signature algorithem utilised in the Ethereum protocol.

The current signing process is as follows:

1. The message to be signed is constructed: ```L_s(T)=(T_n, T_p, T_g, T_t, T_v, T_(i or d))``` where ```T_i``` contains the EVM code if ```T_t=null``` or ```T_d``` is an unlimited size byte array if ```T_t<>null```
2. The Keccak Hash is than calculated: ```h(T)=KEC(L_s(T))
3. The signature process then generates: ```(T_w, T_r, T_s)=ECDSASIGN(h(T),p_r)```, where ```p_r``` is the senders private key.
4. We can then define the sender function S (giving the sender's address) of the transaction as: ```S(T)=B_(96...255) (KEC(ECDSARECOVER(h(T), T_w, T_r, T_s)))

The modification process proposed would be by inserting an extra step between points 1 and 2, which appends an arbitrary value to the transaction. However, unlike in BTC, where the value is taken from the source transatcion, the suggestion here is to utilse a constant value e.g. the transaction hash of block ``Netc = 1920000``` (which contained the execution of an irregular state change in the ETH chain). In this way the process would then become:

1. The message to be signed is constructed: ```L_s(T)=(T_n, T_p, T_g, T_t, T_v, T_(i or d))``` where ```T_i``` contains the EVM code if ```T_t=null``` or ```T_d``` is an unlimited size byte array if ```T_t<>null```
2. Append the Tx Hash of ```Netc``` : ```M_s(T)=(T_n, T_p, T_g, T_t, T_v, T_(i or d), T_Netc)``` 
2. The Keccak Hash is than calculated: ```h(T)=KEC(M_s(T))
3. The signature process then generates: ```(T_w, T_r, T_s)=ECDSASIGN(h(T),p_r)```, where ```p_r``` is the senders private key.
4. We can then define the sender function S (giving the sender's address) of the transaction as: ```S(T)=B_(96...255) (KEC(ECDSARECOVER(h(T), T_w, T_r, T_s)))

In this way no extra information needs to be added to the transactions, the transaction structures would remain backwards compatible and all key symbolic fields would remain unchanged.

Even though this is a much simpler change for implmentation compared to other suggestions and does not require changes to the standard transaction structures, this does require a change in a fundamental process related to the Ethereum Classic protocol. As a result it is a higher risk change and would require much deeper testing to ensure transactions are not lost by users.

The trigger block is expected to be at ```3000000```, which is the HardForking block for delaying the Difficulty Bomb.
