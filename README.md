The Official Ethereum Classic Improvement Process Project
==========================================================

We collect specifications for APIs, file formats, protocols and workflows from all parties that collaborate on Ethereum Classic. This project enables harmony between multiple collaborating parties and is driven by _*rough consensus through working code*_.

You can start contributing by sending a pull request to https://github.com/ethereumproject/ecips on GitHub.

Please read [ecip.ethereumclassic.org](http://ecip.ethereumclassic.org/) for the rendered content.

## Guidelines

* A specification SHOULD be created and modified by pull requests according to [1/C4](1/README.md)
* A Specification's lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [2/COSS](2/README.md)
* A Specification SHOULD use the CC0 license
* A Specification SHOULD use [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) key words.
* Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.

## C4 and COSS are derived from [Unprotocols.org](https://unprotocols.org)

* As [1/C4](1/C4) and [2/COSS](2/COSS) are empirical processes evolved by many communities of programmers, changes to these specifications must first be listed as an issue on the upstream git [repository](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc). Discussion will take place there, not here.
* We will then adopt the stable of C4 and COSS specifications on said repository.
* This is equivalent to the Scientific process, which attempts to weed out inaccuracy, maliciousness, negligence or just plain naivety.
* For this reason Pull Requests that modify or locally fork C4 and COSS will be reverted, unless they are made to reflect upstream stable C4 and COSS.
* These processes are falsifiable.
