# Simple Reply Attack Protection

This is derived
from [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/155). When this
spec is in effect, the following terms should apply.

## Transaction Hashing

If block.number >= FORK_BLKNUM and v = CHAIN_ID * 2 + 35 or v =
CHAIN_ID * 2 + 36, then when computing the hash of a transaction for
purposes of signing or recovering, instead of hashing only the first
six elements (ie. nonce, gasprice, startgas, to, value, data), hash
nine elements, with v replaced by CHAIN_ID, r = 0 and s = 0. The
currently existing signature scheme using v = 27 and v = 28 remains
valid and continues to operate under the same rules as it does now.
