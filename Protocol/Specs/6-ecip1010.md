# Delay Difficulty Bomb Explosion

Derived
from
[ECIP1010](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1010.md).

Current formula for a minimal difficulty is

````
block_diff = parent_diff 
     + parent_diff / 2048 * max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) / 10, -99) 
     + int(2**((block.number / 100000) - 2))
````

The most important part related to Difficulty Bomb is:

````
2**((block.number / 100000) - 2)
````

It’s a lower bound for minimal difficulty, which grows exponentially with next step every 100,000 blocks. `-2` is added to start growth only after the block 200,000

With this formula minimal difficulty is:
* Block 1 == 2**(-2) == 0
* Block 100,000 == 2**(-1) == 0
* Block 200,000 == 2**0 == 1
* Block 300,000 == 2**1 == 2
* Block 1,920,000 == 2**17 == 131,072
* Block 2,000,000 == 2**18 == 262,144
* Block 2,500,000 == 2**23 == 8,388,608
* Block 3,000,000 == 2**28 == 268,435,456
* Block 4,000,000 == 2**38 == 274,877,906,944 or 274 GH
* Block 5,000,000 == 2**48 == 281 TH
* Block 5,200,000 == 2**50 == 1126 TH
* Block 6,000,000 == 2**58 == 288230 TH

Current difficulty used for mining is 8 TH. For a comparison, difficulty in Forked ETH Blockchain is 71 TH.

To pause difficulty growth `(block.number / 100000) - 2` must be fixed to a concrete value for the range 3,000,000 to 5,000,000, then continue growing.

Instead of value `2` it’s proposed to use `n` with a dynamic formula as following:

Constants:
````
pause_block = 3000000 //15 Jan 2017
cont_block = 5000000 //15 Dec 2017
delay = (cont_block - pause_block) / 100000 //20
fixed_diff = (pause_block / 100000) - 2 //28
````

Final formula:
````
if (block.number < pause_block) {
    explosion = (block.number / 100000) - 2    
} else if (block.number < cont_block) {
    explosion = fixed_diff 
} else { // block.number >= cont_block    
    explosion = (block.number / 100000) - delay - 2
}

block_diff = parent_diff 
      + parent_diff / 2048 * max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) / 10, -99) 
      + int(2**explosion)
````

With this changes min difficulty value will become:
* Block 2,500,000 == 2**23 == 8,388,608
* Block 3,000,000 == 2**28 == 268,435,456
* Block 4,000,000 == 2**28 == 268,435,456
* Block 5,000,000 == 2**28 == 268,435,456
* Block 5,200,000 == 2**30 == 1 TH
* Block 6,000,000 == 2**38 == 274 TH
